Ever since, probably my 11th birthday, I have been passionate about IT and programming in itself.<br /><br />


Special thanks to <a href="http://www.schippefilt.com"><strong><u><i>Vincent Schippefilt</i></u></strong></a>, my mentor at Gfi, for assisting and granting me permission to use the timeline - customized by him.<br /><br />


Also thanks to Jannik Richter for the creation of the template using Jekyll and putting it open source under the MIT license.
