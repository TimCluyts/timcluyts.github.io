    The TME Head Office is located in Brussels, Belgium, and houses key activities for Toyota and Lexus in Europe. It also acts as the nerve centre for all European operations including the principal areas of manufacturing & engineering and marketing & sales activities.
    <br /><br />
    Established in 1987, the Toyota Technical Centre in Zaventem, Belgium, is home to Toyota Motor Europe’s Research & Development (R&D), Purchasing and Production Engineering activities. Early in 2006, Toyota inaugurated the expanded technical centre. In 2007 an additional 35,000 m² were added to house the expanded European design and engineering functions.
<br /><br />
<h3>Customer Challenge</h3>
<br />
    The sales and production planners at Toyota had an enormous amount of manual work, transferring and planning the production of vehicles over many different applications and services. Prone to human mistakes through copy-paste work over many different excel files, they required a fully automatic process with minimal human interactions when it comes to planning.
<br /><br />
<h3>Solution</h3>
<br />
    Under my lead, the Gfi team at Toyota created a single page application using ReactJs, Express and NodeJs together with SequelizeJs to communicate with the database. After the initial setup, the software communicates with on-premise services to acquire the neccesary sales and presales data.
    From this set of data, the program is running multiple operations to come to a production planning over the next six month.
<br /><br />
    After the first phase, which required a planning of up to six months in the future, a different department required the attention of the team and was incorporated into the project. After analysing and estimating, we developed the system to be able to plan over the next three years even.
<br /><br />
    The team even developed a fully customized way of exporting which would allow for flexibility between all sets of planned data.
