Hi, I'm Tim Cluyts and I'm a developer mainly in .NET, Javascript and SQL. I've been passionate about IT ever since I started using a computer and continue to do so. I've done some amazing projects working for Gfi, laying emphasis on quality and customer happiness together with my team. Most projects were done pair programming and using TDD.

It means the world to me that you took time out of your busy day to visit my website.<br /><br />

Special thanks to <a href="http://www.schippefilt.com"><strong><u><i>Vincent Schippefilt</i></u></strong></a>, my mentor at Gfi, for assisting and granting me permission to use the timeline - customized by him.<br /><br />
