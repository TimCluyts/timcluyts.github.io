    Total, present in Belgium since 1920, is a major player in the Belgian economic landscape. 4500 employees work in the refinery and petrochemical sector, in new energies and the sale of petroleum products, specialties and earth gas. The historical offices of the Group are at the heart of the European quarter in Brussels.
    <br /><br />
    The Antwerp platform is the gem of Total in refinery-petrochemicals, with over 1700 employees. As the 3rd largest European refinery she produces fuel and primary products destined for her 2 petrochemical units. She also supplies the factory of Feluy, the largest Total production site of polymers in Europe.
<br /><br />
<h3>Customer Challenge</h3>
<br />
    To allow an external contractor access to the Total Antwerp website, he has to go through an extensive approval process. Before today, this involved a huge amount of paper work. Multiple departments are responsible for different aspects in the approval process, for which there is no centralized archiving place inside the Total administration. As a result, contractor employees are able to access the industrial site before being fully approved.
<br /><br />
<h3>Solution</h3>
<br />
    Our team at Gfi created a state of the art web application centralizing every step within the access approval process into one place. A role-user-management systems allows different approval steps to be managed by pre-defined users without other departments having to interfere. A new centralized database hold information on the contractor, his employees and even the necessary documents for approval to enter any Total website. Quick overview screens allow a fast search to see who can enter the Total industrial sites, who cannot and the reasons why.
<br /><br />
    Gfi also implemented an integrated mail system to keep both Total users as well as the contractors updated on their current status within the new application.
